# Redfish Workshop 2023

A workshop to evaluate and synthesize methods for species identification of redfish (*Sebastes mentella* and *S. norvegicus*) in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean (Greenland, Iceland and Faroese waters)

## Date

**13-15 March 2023**

## Venue

Greenland Institute of Natural Resources (GINR), Kivioq 2, 3900 Nuuk, Greenland.

We will meet in three main localities:

- the meeting room "Isbjorn" (TBC) for discussions and presentations
- the fisheries laboratory (TBC) for practical work
- the cafeteria (TBC) for coffee/lunch breaks

## Introduction and aim

The overall main goals of the workshop are to:

- assess whether redfish specimens are identified similarly to species level between the different countries
- assess how high error rates in redfish specimen identification are
- agree on reliable characters to be used for redfish specimen identification
- agree on possible procedures to account for potential errors in the future

## Information and material

All information about this workshop will be available on this [website](https://github.com/notothen/redfish-ws23).
