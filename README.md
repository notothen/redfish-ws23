# Redfish Workshop 2023

A workshop to evaluate and synthesize methods for species identification of redfish (*Sebastes mentella* and *S. norvegicus*) in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean (Greenland and Iceland waters)

## Date

**13-15 March 2023**

## Venue

Greenland Institute of Natural Resources (GINR), Kivioq 2, 3900 Nuuk, Greenland.

We will meet in three main localities:

- the meeting room "Bjørnerum" (TBC) for discussions and presentations
- the fisheries laboratory/wet lab (TBC) for practical work
- the cafeteria (TBC) for coffee/lunch breaks

## Introduction and aim

The overall main goals of the workshop are to:

- assess whether redfish specimens are identified similarly to species level between the different countries
- assess how high error rates in redfish specimen identification are
- agree on reliable characters to be used for redfish specimen identification
- agree on possible procedures to account for potential errors in the future

## Information and material

All information about this workshop will be available here on [this website](https://github.com/notothen/redfish-ws23).

We can also compile presentations, data, links to relevant publications, etc. here.

## Program

### Monday 13th March 2023

Arrival in Nuuk (participants from DEU - participants from ISL arrive earlier). Depending on the arrival timing we may start with some introductions & discussions.

### Tuesday 14th March 2023

**08:00** Welcome and introduction

- description of workshop background and goals
- introduction round of all participants (short presentations?)
- practicalities: venue, working rooms, lunch, coffee, accommodation
- preparations for practical session

**10:00** Coffee

**10:15** Practical session I

- identification of freshly thawed redfish specimens
- everyone should identify as many fish as possible using the same procedure and criteria as on a survey
- in addition, we may record pictures and possibly some morphometric measurements of the fish

**12:00** Lunch

**13:00** Practical session II

- continue with specimen identification
- questionnaire (?) about characters used for specimen identification

**16:00** End of practical session

- time for Henrik, Daniel & Søren to process results
- also time for collaboration discussions, side meetings, evening program, ...

### Wednesday 15th March 2024

**8:00** Free time

- additional time for Henrik, Daniel & Søren to process results
- possible time for further collaboration discussions, side meetings, ...

**10:00** Coffee

**10:15** Presentation of results

- comparison of obtained IDs with genetic IDs
- comparison of these results depending on institute, fish size, true species ID etc.
- additional staff of GINR-FiSk invited

**12:00** Lunch

**13:00** Discussion about perspectives for redfish identification

- integration of survey data from Greenland, Iceland, Germany possible?
- "best practices" for specimen identification?
- next steps?

**16:00-18:00** End of workshop

- joint dinner?

### Thursday 16th March
